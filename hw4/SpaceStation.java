Consider a future fuel station in space that supplies nitrogen and quantum fluid. Assume that the station has a
capacity of handling V space vehicles in parallel (simultaneously) and a maximum storage for N liters of nitrogen and
for Q liters of quantum fluid. When a vehicle arrives at the station it requests the needed amount of fuel of the two
different types or only one of the types. If there is not enough fuel of either type, the vehicle has to wait without
blocking other vehicles. Special supply vehicles deliver fuel in fixed quantities that far exceed a fuel tank capacity
of any vehicle. When a supply vehicle arrives at the station, it delays until there is enough space to deposit the
delivered amount of fuel. To travel back, the supply vehicles also request a certain amount of fuel of the two
different types or one of the types just like an ordinary vehicle, not necessarily the type it supplies.
